- âš¡ Working with Microsoft SQL Server, SQL Server Integration Services, T-SQL and PowerShell by day, hobbyist developer in my free time.
- âš¡ I'm a late-30s dad, and I've been writing random code, for fun, in my free time since I was 15 years old.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Azure, Python, ASP.NET Core, and Blazor. I'm always trying to learn something, diving into whatever is stimulating my brain at that time.
- ðŸ’¡ I'm currently interested in expanding my knowledge of ETL/ELT data pipeline development as it pertains to Data Engineering, Azure and Python.

- âš¡ Working with Microsoft SQL Server and SQL Server Integration Services by day, hobbyist developer in my free time.
- âš¡ I'm a late-30s dad, and I've been writing random code, for fun, in my free time since I was 15 years old.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about ASP.NET Core, and Blazor. I'm always trying to learn something, so I tend to hop around from topic to topic, diving into whatever is stimulating my brain at that time.
- ðŸ’¡ I'm currently interested in Blazor, expanding my knowledge of ETL development in SQL Server Integration Services, Azure and PowerShell.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Blazor server hosted project to help with keeping track of the last time you did something, but I'm waiting on .NET MAUI before I make any sort of public repo.
